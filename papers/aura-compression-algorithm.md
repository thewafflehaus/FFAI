# AURA: a frankenstein compression algorithm

**Authors:** Eric Kryski, Tom Turney **Hardware target:** Apple M1 / M5 Max, 16–512 GB unified memory **Software target:** [FFAI](https://github.com/ekryski/FFAI) — Apple Silicon inference stack (port of the codec formerly shipped as `TurboQuant*` in [mlx-swift-lm](https://github.com/ekryski/mlx-swift-lm)) **Date:** 2026-05-17 (rebranded from working draft 2026-05-09) **Status:** Working draft — implementation notes

> *Our codec was originally shipped as `TurboQuant*` in mlx-swift-lm and is not, in fact, an implementation of the TurboQuant paper. It is a hybrid of TurboQuant_mse, QuaRot, PolarQuant, and llama.cpp's k_quants. This paper documents the honest accounting; the new home is FFAI and the new name is **AURA — Adaptive Unified Rotated Activations**.*

This document gives the straightforward accounting of what the codec actually does, where each piece came from, what we kept, what we dropped, and what we added on top of the published prior art. The codec ships in FFAI under the AURA name; the mlx-swift-lm Swift source files retain their original `TurboQuant*` filenames because renaming them in that project is mechanical churn the team would rather defer, and the file headers point readers here.

**Scope.** AURA is a generic high-dimensional vector quantization codec. The same SRHT-rotation + polar-decomposition + Lloyd-Max-scalar-codebook pipeline applies to any high-dimensional tensor. KV cache is the first deployment target because bandwidth pressure on Apple Silicon hurts most there, and the KV path is what ships in production. We have also exercised the codec on model weights with promising early results (the encode pass is cheaper than QuaRot+GPTQ at comparable PPL because we skip the GPTQ Hessian step). Activations — per-token tensors flowing through the network during forward — are a credible next target on the same primitive but are not yet benchmarked; the open engineering question is whether dynamic per-forward encode cost pays back through downstream int8 or int4 GEMM. The paper is written KV-cache-first because that is the shipping deployment, but the math and the prior-art comparisons apply equally to weights and activations.

This is engineering documentation, not a research-paper novelty claim. Almost every individual move below is published independently elsewhere; the contribution is the specific composition and the Apple-Silicon-tuned kernels.

## 1. Why this paper exists

The divergence surfaced when we were revising [`papers/beyond-quadratic-attention-on-apple-silicon.md`](beyond-quadratic-attention-on-apple-silicon.md) §6.3 and trying to ground the claim that "we already ship a butterfly primitive" in actual code. The §6.3 fact-check found:

- The TurboQuant paper (Zandieh et al., [arXiv 2504.19874](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19874), ICLR 2026) specifies Gaussian-QR rotation, an *analytic per-coordinate* Lloyd-Max quantizer derived from the Beta distribution of rotated coordinates, and a two-stage scheme where Algorithm 2 (QJL — Quantized Johnson-Lindenstrauss on the residual) provides the inner-product unbiasedness guarantee.
- AURA uses a *dual rotation path* (Gaussian-QR or SRHT-via-FWHT, the latter QuaRot-style), an *empirically-derived global 1D codebook* (llama.cpp's k_quants table scaled by √(128/d)), and *no QJL second stage*.
- AURA also promotes the polar (norm + direction) decomposition to a first-class operation, with explicit norm correction in the dense path. The TurboQuant paper treats norm rescaling as a trivial pre-step; PolarQuant ([arXiv 2502.02617](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02617)) puts it at the centre of its framing.
- Several engineering moves do not appear in any of the source papers: pre-rotated queries reused across all keys in a layer, two-phase prefill→compress→decode architecture, asymmetric K/V bit-widths, boundary-layer fp16 protection.

Summarised honestly, what we ship is "TurboQuant_mse + QuaRot + PolarQuant + llama.cpp k_quants + several engineering additions." That summary is not what readers will infer from a name like `TurboQuant*`. Hence the rename to AURA.

## 2. The AURA pipeline

The full encode + decode story for one K or V tensor of shape `[B, H, T, D]`, at codec configuration `(bits, rotation_mode)`:

### 2.1 Encode (per cached vector x ∈ R^D)

```
1. r        = ||x||_2                                       # scalar, kept in fp16
2. u        = x / r                                          # unit-sphere direction
3. y        = Π · u                                          # random orthogonal rotation
4. (i_1..i_D) = boundaryQuantize(y, codebook)                # per-coord Lloyd-Max
5. packed   = bitpack(i_1..i_D)                              # b · D bits → uint32 lanes
6. r̂        = ||codebook[i_1..i_D]||_2                       # reconstructed norm
7. r_corr   = r / r̂                                          # norm correction (dense path only)
8. STORE (packed, r_corr)
```

Step 7's norm correction compensates for per-coordinate quantization error in the dense-rotation path. The SRHT/FWHT path skips it because orthogonal SRHT preserves norms exactly (`r̂ = r`).

### 2.2 Rotation Π — two paths

- **Dense path.** Π is a `[D, D]` orthogonal matrix obtained by QR-decomposing a random Gaussian. This matches the TurboQuant paper directly. Used for non-power-of-2 head dims (Mistral's 80, Phi's 96, etc.) and for the decode-time query rotation described in §2.4.
- **SRHT / FWHT path.** Π = H · diag(s) / √D where H is the Sylvester Hadamard matrix and s is a fixed random ±1 sign vector. Implemented as a Metal kernel: a radix-2 butterfly in two phases, with stages 0–4 using `simd_shuffle_xor` for intra-SIMD register-to-register shuffles (no shared memory) and stages 5+ using threadgroup shared memory for the cross-SIMD butterfly. Power-of-2 head dims up to 1024. The original mlx-swift-lm reference lives at [`TurboQuantKernels.swift:218–338`](https://github.com/ekryski/mlx-swift-lm/blob/alpha/Libraries/MLXLMCommon/TurboQuantKernels.swift); the FFAI port will sit under `Sources/FFAI/AURA*.swift` + `crates/metaltile-std/src/ffai/aura*.rs`.

The Rademacher randomization `diag(s)` is mathematically required for the JL concentration property that flattens activation distributions for quantization (QuaRot Sec. 4 makes the argument formally). Without it, plain WHT can *amplify* outliers aligned with H's columns. Runtime cost of SRHT vs plain WHT is essentially zero — one elementwise sign multiply that fuses into adjacent ops — so we pay nothing for the guarantee.

Π is fixed at codec init. Never learned. QuaRot-style, not SpinQuant-style.

### 2.3 Codebook

The codebook is a 1D table of `K = 2^bits` Lloyd-Max-optimal scalar levels. Values are mined from llama.cpp's `k_quants` work — derived empirically for unit-variance Gaussian data at d=128 and then validated on real LLM weight/activation distributions. We adapt them to other head dims by scaling: `codebook_d = codebook_128 · √(128/d)`. The scaling is a heuristic that approximately recovers the paper's analytic `1/√d` Beta-variance scaling.

The codebook is **global**: shared across all coordinates, heads, and layers. The TurboQuant paper specifies *per-coordinate* quantizers; AURA uses one shared table. For high-dimensional data where the rotated coordinates are approximately i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed — they don't correlate with each other and they all follow the same Beta distribution after the random rotation has whitened them) the approximation is reasonable, but it does diverge from the paper. The motivation is engineering simplicity and kernel register pressure: one codebook fits in registers; D per-coord codebooks do not.

### 2.4 Decode and compressed-domain attention

At inference time the cache holds `(packed_indices, r_corr)` per token. The naive decode path is:

```
1. unpacked      = codebook[indices]                         # gather from indices
2. u_recon       = unpacked · Π^T                            # inverse rotation
3. x_recon       = r_corr · u_recon                          # rescale by norm
```

That naive path never runs during attention. Instead, a **compressed-domain attention** kernel computes:

```
q'       = Π · q                                             # pre-rotated query, once per layer
score[t] = r_corr[t] · Σ_j q'[j] · codebook[indices[t, j]]   # per-key dot product
```

The mathematical identity is `q · x_recon = (Π · q) · (Π · u_recon) · r_corr = q' · u_recon · r_corr`. Because Π is orthogonal (`Π · Π^T = I`) the two rotations cancel, so attention scores can be computed directly against the packed indices with no materialised `x_recon` tensor. Pre-rotating `q` once per layer and reusing it across all T cached keys is the bandwidth win.

Each SIMD group (32 threads) handles one `(query, key_token)` pair. The codebook (≤16 entries at 4-bit) sits in thread-local registers. Bit unpacking + codebook lookup + dot product all happen in-register. Zero global-memory dequant materialization.

This is **PolarQuant's "decoding acceleration"** idea applied with AURA's codebook structure. The PolarQuant paper turns the query-key inner product into a table lookup; we do the same but look up a scalar codebook entry rather than reconstructing a polar angle.

**Would reconstructing polar angles be faster?** Worth answering carefully, because on paper the score-time arithmetic is in PolarQuant's favour, and this is an open future direction we have not yet pursued.

PolarQuant decomposes a D-dim vector recursively into log₂(D) levels of nested polar angles plus one final radius. At D=128 that's 7 angle levels. *Reconstructing the d-dim vector on the fly* requires recursive cos/sin terms applied to a running product — genuinely expensive transcendental work on every coordinate. So naive on-the-fly polar reconstruction is slower than codebook lookup.

The PolarQuant paper, however, does not operate in that regime. Like AURA, it **precomputes a centroid table** of quantized angle values at each polar level (e.g. 16 angles at level 1, 4 angles at levels 2–4). Decoding then becomes a sequence of table lookups and products rather than transcendental evaluations. At the *compressed-domain scoring* level PolarQuant requires only `log₂(D)` lookups per cached vector instead of D. The score formula for a polar-encoded key against a pre-rotated query becomes a product over the 7 angle levels rather than a sum over 128 coordinates — on paper, ~18× cheaper at score time.

Three engineering reasons it isn't shipped yet:

1. **The recursive decode kernel is harder to write in Metal than the single-shot codebook lookup.** Each angle level depends on the previous level's reconstructed direction, so the kernel cannot flatten into one SIMD-group-per-(query, key) pair the way AURA's does. Either accept warp divergence at each level or restructure the kernel pipeline.
2. **The encode pass has to compute polar angles** (`atan2` per pair, recursive). AURA's encode is `boundaryQuantize(rotated_coord)` per element — a single binary search against the codebook. Encode is one-shot at prefill but the kernel complexity adds up.
3. **AURA's compressed-domain scoring composes for free with a scalar codebook** — one SIMD group computes the dot product against the packed indices in-register, no shared memory needed. The polar variant needs accumulation state across angle levels, costing either shared memory or threadgroup synchronisation.

The honest assessment: polar encoding is probably a small per-token decode win and a meaningful bit-rate win at the cost of a substantially more complex kernel. Tracked as an open question in §5.7.

### 2.5 Engineering additions

Four moves that do not appear in any source paper:

1. **Two-phase architecture.** Prefill writes raw fp16 K and V into a buffer. At the start of decode (or at decode milestone N) the buffer is batch-encoded into compressed storage in one large dispatch. Decode reads from compressed storage exclusively. This hides encode cost inside TTFT instead of paying it per-token.

2. **Pre-rotated queries.** Compute `q' = Π · q` once per layer at decode time and reuse across all T cached keys. The cost is one `[D, D]` matmul (or one FWHT) per layer per token; the win is that AURA never performs `T` inverse rotations of the cache values. At T=128K and D=128 this is several orders of magnitude less rotation work per decode token.

3. **Asymmetric K/V bit-widths.** Recipes ship K and V at different precisions. The `aura4v2` config uses 4-bit K + 2-bit V; the production `q8_0-K + aura4-V` recipe runs 8.5-bit K + 4.25-bit V for 2.5× compression. The asymmetry is justified by the math: K precision matters because softmax exponentiates the dot products (a perturbation of ε in logit space produces an O(e^ε) change in the attention distribution); V precision matters less because the V-aggregation is a weighted *average* in which errors scale linearly through the weighted sum (`O(w_i · ε)`) and non-dominant positions have near-zero weights that absorb the noise. Catastrophic example from Tom Turney's [`asymmetric-kv-compression.md`](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/asymmetric-kv-compression.md): on Qwen2.5-7B, symmetric turbo3/turbo3 produces PPL 3,556 — catastrophic — while asymmetric q8_0-K + turbo3-V achieves PPL 6.71 (+2.0% vs baseline). Independently documented in KIVI ([arXiv 2402.02750](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02750), "Plug-and-Play 2bit KV Cache Quantization"), which uses 2-bit K + 4-bit V on the same softmax-amplification reasoning, and in KVQuant ([arXiv 2401.18079](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18079)), which characterises the per-channel K outlier pattern that motivates the precision asymmetry. AURA adopts the K-heavy recipe from this prior art rather than rediscovering it. (Tom's bench numbers above are documented under the original `turbo*` scheme names; the same recipes in FFAI's namespace are `aura3` / `q8_0-K + aura3-V` etc.)

4. **Boundary-layer fp16 protection.** The first and last N attention layers stay in fp16 because residual-stream depth is shallow at the edges — V errors in boundary layers either affect every subsequent layer's attention output (first layers) or directly distort the output distribution (last layers). Middle layers operate on abstracted representations where V precision has less marginal impact. The empirical recipe in Tom Turney's [`layer-aware-v-compression.md`](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/layer-aware-v-compression.md) ("LA-V7" / Boundary V): q8_0 V cache on layers `{0, 1, N-2, N-1}`, turbo2 V cache on all other layers, K cache at q8_0 throughout. Validated independently by `@sztlink` who confirmed boundary layers have extreme K norms (146.8 at layer 0 vs 20–40 in the middle) — tighter Gaussian distributions are ideal for low-precision quantization elsewhere but they also mean the boundary layers are *more* sensitive to V noise because the attention is more concentrated there. Same per-layer-importance intuition as Q-Hitter ([arXiv 2402.14905](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14905)), SqueezeAttention ([arXiv 2404.04793](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04793), 2D budget allocation clusters layers by cosine similarity), and KVQuant's boundary-aware quantization. **Caveat:** the boundary-layer rule was developed on pure-attention models (phi-4, Qwen2.5); hybrid models like Qwen3.5 with Gated Delta Net (where only every fourth layer carries softmax KV state) need a different layer-counting convention or the boundary protection mis-targets the wrong layers.

## 3. Prior art map — what we kept, dropped, borrowed

### 3.1 TurboQuant (Zandieh, Daliri, Hadian, Mirrokni — Google Research / ICLR 2026)

**The paper:** [arXiv 2504.19874](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19874). Online vector quantization with near-optimal distortion rate. Two algorithms: TurboQuant_mse (rotation + analytic per-coordinate Lloyd-Max from Beta distribution) and TurboQuant_prod (TurboQuant_mse + 1-bit QJL on the residual for unbiased inner-product estimation).

**What we kept:**
- The core insight: random rotation makes coordinate distributions approximately i.i.d. Beta, which lets a fixed Lloyd-Max scalar quantizer achieve near-optimal MSE.
- The Gaussian-QR rotation path (one of AURA's two rotation paths).
- The general bit-rate / quality story.

**What we dropped:**
- **QJL second stage entirely.** The paper's headline near-optimal inner-product distortion rate comes from QJL. We don't ship it. The decision was empirical and backed by independent benchmarking — not just engineering convenience. Tom Turney's [turbo4 resurrection write-up (Mar 2026)](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/turbo4-resurrection.md) reports the bench that drove the call:
  - **PPL/KLD regress with QJL on.** Three independent groups confirmed QJL eliminates the bias but "explodes variance that softmax then amplifies." On Llama-class models, QJL-on degraded from −0.28% PPL at 2K context to **+3.69% PPL at 64K** — a clear long-context degradation trend.
  - **Speed regresses with QJL on.** QJL-off decode was **79.87 tok/s vs turbo3's 76.84 tok/s** at the same effective bit-width. The extra dispatch + memory traffic for the residual projection wasn't free and didn't pay back in quality.
  - **NIAH retention improves with QJL off.** 31/33 vs q8_0's 30/33 at long context.
  - The fix: take the bit-budget that QJL would have used and **invest it in more centroids instead** — 16 optimal centroids vs 8-centroids + QJL bit. That is the path the turbo4 resurrection took, and the path AURA ships.

Mathematically the failure mode is straightforward: QJL is an *unbiased* estimator of the inner product but with higher variance than the MSE-only estimator. Variance compounds across decode steps in autoregressive generation, and softmax exponentiates the error — a small variance increase on logits becomes a large probability shift on the sampled token. The bias QJL removes is the 2/π term from Sec. 3.2 of the paper, which diminishes with bit-width and is acceptable at 4-bit. Trading a small bounded bias for unbounded variance amplification was the wrong call for attention, even if it gives optimal-rate guarantees for offline vector search where the estimator's variance averages out over many queries.

- **Per-coordinate codebooks.** The paper specifies one Lloyd-Max quantizer per dimension. AURA uses one global 1D codebook for all coordinates. The approximation is justified by the high-dim i.i.d.-Beta assumption but it is a real divergence.
- **Analytic codebook derivation.** Paper gives closed-form quantizer values per bit-width from the Beta distribution variance. AURA uses llama.cpp's empirically-derived k_quants table.

**What we added:**
- Dual rotation paths (paper has Gaussian-QR only; AURA has Gaussian-QR + SRHT/FWHT).
- Explicit polar decomposition with norm correction (paper has norm rescaling as a pre-step, not first-class).
- Pre-rotated queries + compressed-domain attention kernel (paper is generic VQ; AURA is attention-specific).
- Two-phase prefill→compress→decode architecture.
- Asymmetric K/V, boundary-layer protection.

**Verdict:** what AURA ships is the **TurboQuant_mse half** of the paper, structurally faithful to the rotation + Lloyd-Max scalar quant insight, but with the per-coordinate codebook approximated as a global codebook and the QJL guarantee given up.

### 3.2 TurboQuant_plus (community fork — TheTom)

**The repo:** [github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus). Experimental llama.cpp-targeted fork of TurboQuant. Not a paper. The canonical write-up of the QJL removal experiment is [`turbo4-resurrection.md`](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/turbo4-resurrection.md) (Tom Turney, March 2026) — the same bench results cited in §3.1.

**Notes that match the AURA codec:**
- Replaces Gaussian-QR with SRHT via WHT.
- Drops QJL on the empirical bench reasoning detailed in §3.1 (long-context PPL/KLD regression with QJL on, plus a small decode-tok/s regression from the extra residual-projection dispatch). The resurrection-paper conclusion that "more centroids > error correction" matches the call we made.
- Adopts PolarQuant's norm-extraction framing.
- Discusses asymmetric K/V, boundary protection, sparse-V.

**Verdict:** AURA is *closer in spirit to turboquant_plus than to the ICLR paper*, by direct collaboration — we worked alongside Tom Turney to port several of his insights (the QJL-off decision, the asymmetric K/V recipes, the boundary-layer protection scheme) into mlx-swift-lm's Metal kernel pipeline and now FFAI's. He is listed as co-author on this paper for that reason.

### 3.3 QuaRot (Ashkboos et al. — [arXiv 2404.00456](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00456))

**The paper:** establishes Hadamard rotations as the practical fast alternative to dense Gaussian rotations for LLM quantization. Random Hadamard pre-rotation flattens activation distributions so int4/int8 grids cover the dynamic range without clipping. Rotations are fixed at calibration time.

**What we borrowed:**
- The SRHT / FWHT rotation path. AURA's `whtSigns` + radix-2 Sylvester butterfly is literally the QuaRot construction.
- The justification for *why* the rotation is mathematically necessary (JL concentration, not just an outlier-smoothing heuristic).

**What we didn't borrow:**
- QuaRot quantizes weights and activations *and* KV cache. AURA only does KV cache in the shipping path. Weight quantization is handled separately (AURA is KV-specific in production today).
- QuaRot uses uniform-grid int4 after rotation. AURA uses Lloyd-Max non-uniform centroid grid (from llama.cpp k_quants).

### 3.4 SpinQuant (Liu et al. — [arXiv 2405.16406](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16406))

**The paper:** *learned* rotations. Instead of random fixed rotations, fine-tune the rotation matrix on a calibration corpus to minimize quantization error. Small training cost, better quality than random.

**What we borrowed:** nothing directly.

**Why not:** AURA's rotations are random and fixed. Adopting SpinQuant-style learned rotations would require a per-model calibration pass that updates Π. The engineering cost is real (per-model training infrastructure, calibration data dependency, sanitize() complexity) and the quality lift over random is in the 1–3% PPL range — useful but not blocking. **Tracked as a future direction** (§5 below).

### 3.5 PolarQuant (Han, Kacham, Mirrokni, Zandieh, Karbasi — [arXiv 2502.02617](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02617); NeurIPS 2025 variant at [arXiv 2502.00527](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00527))

**The paper:** quantizes the KV cache by (1) applying a random orthogonal preconditioning rotation, (2) decomposing each vector recursively into nested polar angles + a final radius, (3) quantizing the angles only, keeping the radius in fp16. ~3.875 effective bits per coord with near-lossless quality and ~14% decode speedup.

**What we borrowed:**
- The **norm + direction** decomposition as a first-class operation. AURA's `r = ||x||` + `u = x/r` split is the PolarQuant framing made explicit.
- The decode-time **query-key inner product as a table-lookup** framing. PolarQuant's polar-table lookup is structurally analogous to AURA's compressed-domain scoring kernel, just with a scalar codebook instead of a polar angle table.

**What we didn't borrow:**
- The actual polar-angles encoding. AURA quantizes the rotated *Cartesian* coordinates against a 1D scalar codebook; PolarQuant quantizes nested polar *angles*. The angles encoding gives PolarQuant slightly lower bit rate at comparable quality, but the decode kernel is recursive (cos/sin reconstruction at each polar level) which is non-trivial on Metal.

**Verdict:** PolarQuant influences AURA's *framing* (norm/direction as a first-class split) and its *decode-time optimization* (pre-rotated queries → compressed-domain scoring), but not its *encoding* (Cartesian-coord scalar quant, not polar-angles quant).

### 3.6 RaBitQ (Gao & Long — [SIGMOD 2024, arXiv 2405.12497](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12497); Extended SIGMOD 2025, [arXiv 2409.09913](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09913))

**The paper:** *randomized binary vector quantization* for nearest-neighbor search in high-dim vector databases. Random orthogonal rotation, then encode each vector by the *signs* of its rotated coordinates — 1 bit per dimension. Theoretical guarantee: inner-product estimation error is O(1/√D), provably matching the FOCS 2017 lower bound for D-bit codes.

**What we borrowed:** nothing yet, but the conceptual relationship is tight enough to call out.

**Why it's relevant:** RaBitQ is the **extreme low-bit endpoint** of the same family as TurboQuant and AURA. RaBitQ at 1-bit = "sign of rotated coordinate"; AURA at 4-bit = "nearest of 16 Lloyd-Max levels of rotated coordinate." Same rotation, same Cartesian-coord-after-rotation framing, much smaller codebook. The author has publicly contested TurboQuant's novelty claim relative to RaBitQ — the 1-bit special case is structurally identical and RaBitQ pre-dates TurboQuant. See [author's medium post](https://dev.to/gaoj0017/turboquant-and-rabitq-what-the-public-story-gets-wrong-1i00) and the response paper [arXiv 2604.19528](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.19528).

**Why we don't ship 1-bit RaBitQ today:** 1-bit per coord is too aggressive for KV cache — quality regresses sharply on retrieval-heavy workloads. The Extended RaBitQ (2–9 bits/coord) is closer to AURA's operating point, and its 4-bit configuration is essentially equivalent to AURA 4-bit minus the Lloyd-Max codebook (RaBitQ uses uniform-grid nested codes). **Worth a bench if/when we want a cleaner mathematical analysis** of the codec's quality vs RaBitQ's theoretical bound.

### 3.7 QuIP# (Tseng, Chee, Sun, Kuleshov, De Sa — Cornell RelaxML — [arXiv 2402.04396](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04396); ICML 2024)

**The paper:** "QuIP#: Even Better LLM Quantization with Hadamard Incoherence and Lattice Codebooks." The conceptual ancestor of HIGGS — the same Hadamard-incoherence + structured-codebook framing that HIGGS later applies in a data-free regime. Original QuIP ([arXiv 2307.13304](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13304), NeurIPS 2023) introduced the "incoherence" argument: a random orthogonal pre-rotation makes the rotated weights have rows/columns of approximately even magnitude and rounding directions that aren't axis-aligned, enabling provable 2-bit quantization bounds. QuIP# upgrades both the rotation (Kronecker random orthogonal → Randomized Hadamard Transform, O(n log n) instead of O(n√n)) and the codebook (scalar adaptive rounding → **vector quantization on the E8 lattice**, the optimal 8-dim sphere-packing).

**What we borrowed:** nothing directly, but the framing is the conceptual root of half this paper's prior art. QuIP# established that **(a)** a Hadamard rotation makes the rotated distribution provably sub-Gaussian and ball-shaped, and **(b)** a codebook co-designed with the post-rotation distribution (E8 lattice, optimal for 8-dim Gaussian balls) is the principled choice. HIGGS later generalised the codebook to multivariate Gaussian-MSE-optimal grids at arbitrary block size p ∈ {1, …, 5}. QuaRot and SpinQuant carried the Hadamard rotation idea over from weights to activations and KV cache.

**Why it's not in the head-to-head:**
- **Weight-only.** QuIP# quantizes pretrained weights once; it does not handle activations, KV cache, or any streaming/online quantization regime. KV cache adaptation would be non-trivial: (a) you can't run QuIP#'s inter-layer fine-tuning at inference, (b) E8 lattice VQ packs 8-dim chunks of the weight matrix together, which conflicts with per-token per-head granularity in a KV cache, (c) the codebook needs to live in threadgroup memory at decode time (~1 KB — workable on Metal, but a real kernel engineering item).
- **Vector quantization on lattices**, not polar / scalar / per-coord. Conceptually closer to HIGGS's p-dim lattice than to AURA's scalar codebook.
- **No polar decomposition.** Norm and direction are quantized together via the E8 lattice, not separated.
- **No Metal port.** CUDA-only repo; an Apple-Silicon adaptation would mean rewriting the lattice-lookup kernel from scratch.

**Verdict:** adjacent prior art — the originator of the Hadamard-incoherence + lattice-codebook framing that HIGGS inherits, and a sibling-in-spirit to QuaRot/SpinQuant for the rotation argument. Not a direct competitor to AURA since it's weight-only with no streaming variant. Listed in the summary table (§4) for completeness but the comparison is structurally apples-to-oranges.

### 3.8 HIGGS (Malinovskii et al. — Yandex Research / ISTA — [arXiv 2411.17525](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17525); NAACL 2025)

**The paper:** "Pushing the Limits of LLM Quantization via the Linearity Theorem." Proves that under mild assumptions, end-to-end PPL is approximately linear in layer-wise relative Frobenius error — so minimizing layer-wise reconstruction error is approximately optimal for end-to-end quality. Uses this to allocate bits unevenly across layers in a data-free regime. Implementation: random Hadamard rotation + *Gaussian-MSE-optimal lattice grid* on small blocks (p ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}); p=1 reduces to scalar quant similar to NF4, p≥2 is genuine multivariate VQ.

**What we borrowed:** nothing directly.

**What's relevant:**
- The **linearity theorem** is the formal justification for AURA's boundary-layer-protection heuristic. HIGGS proves you can rationally allocate fewer bits to "easy" layers and more to "hard" ones; AURA approximates that with a coarse fp16-at-edges rule, but a calibration-driven per-layer bit budget is the principled version.
- The **multivariate Gaussian-MSE grid** (p≥2) is the natural upgrade from AURA's 1D scalar codebook. p=2 codes pairs of coordinates jointly with a 2D Voronoi grid; p=3 codes triples. The compression and quality wins are real (Llama-3.1-8B at 3.25 bits: p=4 hits 6.64 PPL on WikiText vs scalar's 7.13).

**Why we don't ship HIGGS-style lattice VQ today:** the encode kernel needs a small-LUT indexed gather per p-dim block, which is feasible on Metal but not yet implemented in MLX mainline. **Tracked as a future direction** — multivariate Gaussian grids are probably the single most credible upgrade to AURA's codebook structure.

## 5. Open questions and future directions

Worth specing or research-tracking as follow-on work:

1. **Per-coordinate codebooks.** The paper specifies per-dim Lloyd-Max quantizers; AURA uses one global codebook. Worth benchmarking whether per-dim recovers measurable PPL on real models. Kernel cost is modest — D codebooks instead of 1 — but register pressure goes up.

2. **HIGGS-style multivariate Gaussian-MSE lattice.** Replace AURA's 1D scalar codebook with a 2D or 3D Voronoi grid trained via CLVQ on Gaussian samples. Probably the single most credible quality upgrade. Tracked separately; needs a small LUT-gather kernel on Metal.

3. **SpinQuant-style learned rotations.** Fine-tune Π per model on a calibration corpus. Quality lift ~1–3% PPL — useful, with real engineering cost (per-model training infrastructure, sanitize() complexity, calibration data dependency).

4. **Centroid-routed sparse decode** (= AURA + spec 034 fused). Today the codebook is per-coordinate scalar; if we upgrade to a *vector* or *product-quantization* codebook (HIGGS p≥2 style), the codebook itself becomes the per-query top-k selector. Precompute `Q · centroids` once per layer (small table), then per-cached-vector scoring becomes one index lookup + one scalar multiply — `O(1)` per key instead of `O(D)`. Composes cleanly with spec 034 and is one of the most exciting research directions for the KV codec. See `papers/beyond-quadratic-attention-on-apple-silicon.md` §6.3 for context.

5. **RaBitQ-style 1-bit storage tier.** For workloads that can tolerate it (long-context summarization, low-entropy retrieval), a 1-bit "sign of rotated coord" tier would give 32× compression over fp16. Probably too aggressive for general use but could be a third tier alongside 4-bit and 8-bit.

6. **Fix the codebook scaling.** The √(128/d) heuristic is a hack to adapt the d=128 Lloyd-Max table to other head dims. The principled fix is to re-derive the codebook analytically per head dim from the Beta distribution variance, as the TurboQuant paper specifies. Low engineering cost; might recover small quality on non-128 head dims (Mistral, Phi, anything with d ∈ {64, 80, 96, 256}).

7. **PolarQuant-style polar angle encoding** as an alternative codebook. Detailed in §2.4 — on paper the compressed-domain scoring is ~18× cheaper per cached key (log₂(D) angle-table lookups instead of D scalar-codebook lookups) and the bit rate is ~3% smaller at comparable quality. The cost is a more complex Metal kernel (recursive accumulation across angle levels can't flatten into one SIMD-group-per-(query,key) the way scalar lookup does, and the encode pass needs `atan2` + recursive polar reduction). Worth a real bench against `aura4-V` to settle whether the score-time win materialises into end-to-end decode tok/s.

8. **Source-tree rename completion.** mlx-swift-lm Swift files retain their `TurboQuant*` filenames; FFAI's new home uses `AURA*` filenames natively from day one. Whether to back-port the rename into the mlx-swift-lm tree is deferred — arguments for it are honest naming and fewer surprised readers; arguments against are mechanical churn and breaking downstream search/grep against the existing header comments that already point readers here.

9. **Scope expansion — weights and activations.** The pipeline is target-agnostic, so AURA applies to any high-dim tensor. KV is what ships; weights have been tested with promising early results; activations remain untested. The interesting engineering questions for each target are different:
   - **Weights:** the codec already works on weight matrices. The remaining question is whether it competes against QuaRot+GPTQ at the same bit rate without the GPTQ Hessian pass — preliminary numbers say yes for matrices small enough that the per-tensor SRHT rotation amortises (most of the FFN, all of QKV). Worth a full sweep against existing 4-bit weight schemes on Llama-class and Qwen-class checkpoints.
   - **Activations:** dynamic quantization per-forward changes the engineering profile substantially. Encode cost matters because it runs N times per token instead of once per cache write. Only worth doing if the downstream GEMM uses the int8/int4 path natively (avoiding a quantize-then-dequantize round-trip). Composes naturally with the planned BitNet-style ternary work (`papers/beyond-quadratic-attention-on-apple-silicon.md` §4.9) — quantized activations × ternary weights is the cleanest version of this story. **Untested as of this writing**; the open question is whether SRHT + per-coord Lloyd-Max recovers enough quality for int4 activation × int4 weight matmuls on Llama/Qwen-class models vs the QuaRot+W4A8 baseline.
   - **Composition with the shipping KV path.** If activations are quantized in the rotated/Lloyd-Max domain *before* they get written to KV cache, the cache write becomes a no-op (just a copy). That's a real bandwidth win at long context, and it's the unified codec story that makes scope expansion strategically attractive.
